## Recursion

To work on these problems:
Clone this repo onto your computer if you have git installed. If not, sign into Cloud9 (c9.io) and create a new project, pasting this page's url into the "Clone from Git" section as you do.

## Problems

1. Implement a function for finding the sum of an array of numbers using recursion
2. Implement a function that returns the nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...)

Challenge:

Create a function that will take an amount (in cents) and an array of US currency values (also in cents) and return the number of ways you can use those coins to make change for that amount
